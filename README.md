# TCP/IP STACK C

## GOALS
- Implement Data Encapsulation amd De-encapsulation.
- Implement Shortest Path Algorithm(Dijkstra Algorithm).
- Packet exchange simulation.
- ARP
- L2 MAC based Forwarding.
- Ping
- L3 routing
- Dynamic construction of L3 routing
- Implemented practical version of OSI model.
- Implemented all the logic to parse the packet content, evaluate packet hdr content and take decision what to do with the packet.
- Implemented VLAN based forwarding with Access ports and trunk ports
- Cooked up the packets from the scratch
- Implemented ARP and ARP table.
- Implemented L2 switching.
- On demand ARP resolution.
